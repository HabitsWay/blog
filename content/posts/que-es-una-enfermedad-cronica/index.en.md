**HABITS**, as we introduced you earlier, focuses on chronic diseases. But what is a chronic disease? Many times we ask ourselves this question and we do not know how to define it. Chronic illness is defined as an illness or condition that lasts 3 months or longer and may get worse over time.

In the last `European Health Survey in Spain (EESE)` carried out during 2019-2020 and published in 2021, which aims to obtain information on the health status of its inhabitants, it is observed that approximately 75% of the population older than 15 years refers to a good or very good state of health. Keep in mind that the older you are, the worse this perception is. The younger population reports more than 90% that they have a good or very good state of health and the population aged 85 or over only 30% report this state of good health. If we look at the graph, we are losing quality of life as we get older.

Another interesting piece of information provided by this `EESE` survey is that it observes that 54.4% of the population over 15 years of age have reported a chronic health problem in the last 12 months. So the numbers that we are presenting to you are important.

Such is its importance that in 2017 the `Spanish Society of Family and Community Medicine (semFyC)` published an article entitled _<<Little bed, little plate and a lot of shoe sole>>_. What do you mean? Well, **many chronic diseases can improve their symptoms with physical exercise**. Specifically 26 diseases! So let's go for it. If you have a chronic disease, get advice from an expert, surely the symptoms will improve or the progression will be slower.

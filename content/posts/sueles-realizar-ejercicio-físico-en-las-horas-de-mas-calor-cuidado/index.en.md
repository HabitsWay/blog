Hi everyone,

In Spain, we are having a more than hot summer, we are in the middle of August in a heat wave in different autonomous communities and with many fires around.
(See: https://web.gencat.cat/es/actualitat/detall/La-quinzena-mes-calorosa)

Just before the bridge on August 15, a relative suggested that I go for a walk at midday in the Community of Murcia because it was cloudy and, therefore, we could do **physical exercise**. You know that **physical exercise** in the posts that we have been publishing and those that will come in the future is one of our basic pillars in **HABITS**. The so-called little pill that we always comment that pharmaceutical companies would like to invent. But be careful, we must also keep in mind that depending on the weather conditions it can be counterproductive for our health in some time slots. For this reason, that proposition gave me the idea of making this post. Because around us, whether in our usual municipality near Barcelona, on the beach on the Barcelona coast, in inland Galicia or in the Rías Baixas or on the inland coast of the Community of Murcia, we have observed people doing sports at temperatures that they are not, at all, adequate for health, leaving aside if we have chronic disease or are super healthy.

The `World Health Organization (WHO)` recommends doing between 150-300 minutes of moderate exercise per week or between 75 and 150 minutes of moderate to intense exercise. We could say between 3 and 5 days a week. Many people believe that the maximum temperature is at 12 noon, but this is not the case. Experts indicate that in summer the hottest hours are between 3 and 4 hours after solar noon. It would be the equivalent between 17:00 and 19:00 in the afternoon. We have to bear in mind that this solar midday will not be the same in all towns, therefore it is important to check the temperature before going out to do an intense physical activity outside, be it running, basketball, soccer, crossfit, among others.

In addition, we encourage you to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration as well as the administration of sunscreen on your skin 30 minutes before the exhibition.

Finally, we remind you of symptoms of heat stroke due to intense exercise or prolonged exposure to heat:

* Thermometered fever with a temperature of 40 degrees or higher.
* Alteration of sweating: hot, reddened and dry skin, it may be slightly damp when performing physical exercise.
* Increased respiratory and heart rate
* Headache
* Disorientation and confusion
* Nausea and vomiting


So from HABITS we encourage you to do physical exercise this summer but with your head.

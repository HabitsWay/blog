When a family member or best friend is diagnosed with cancer of this magnitude after routine testing, it's like a steamroller has run over us. That is why, on many occasions, we do not know how to act in this situation with the people closest to us and those we love.

For this reason, I am going to expose some tips, but they do not have to be useful for all women, if they are for one or two it will already be worth it, although I trust that some of them will help you or you will be able to apply them.

1. **Control your emotions**

Don't get nervous because the other person will have already done it, let's not think negatively because the other person will have already done it, let's not compare with other cases because the other person will have already done it, don't ask a thousand questions at once because the other person will have already done them.

2. **Don't overwhelm**

When we hear this news, it is better to wait for the affected person to get in touch directly, since they surely need to digest what is happening and do not want to express their feelings to anyone: out of fear, out of shame, out of not knowing what to say. , because she is disoriented and out of place, for many other very personal reasons that must be respected. You have to let the days or weeks go by until she wants to talk.

3. **Don't look at the internet**

Trusting the internet is a mistake. It is an easy resource where you can consult anything, be it advice, look for quick solutions, diagnoses or advice, at the most critical moments to understand what is happening, but perhaps it is not what the person who is looking for it needs. It can cause depression, suffering, sadness, bad vibrations, etc. Stop him from doing it.

4. **Keep you from feeling guilty**

It's normal to have negative thoughts, but you should never feel guilty about your diagnosis. There will be toxic people who say that it is because of the life they led, you have to get away from these people. Cancer is caused by many factors, even if you have had a healthy life with a good diet and playing sports. It helps to have a healthy environment, it is not about looking for blame, but solutions.

5. **Accompany her to consultations**

Even if you don't want to, you shouldn't let her go to the tests or the doctor alone. Not only for what it means, but for everything there is to learn in a short time from this new world. It is also important that you take notes so that everyone remembers what was said, or have questions or doubts prepared because once there we are all nervous, as well as write down the medications you take.

6. **Listen**

Anyone needs to let off steam, but in extreme situations even more so. This is when we can help and offer our understanding and listen to anything you feel like explaining, some things may not make much sense because of the anger you feel and the ups and downs you go through, you still have to ride out the downpour. The protagonist is her.

7. **Involve her**

Although the world seems to have stopped, it is important that she feels accompanied and not forgotten. If you talk about current issues or any topic other than cancer, you have to try to get her to participate and contribute ideas or her opinion on something different from what torments her to try to get her to think about other things for a while. If there are activities or events for her to distract herself from, even a getaway or a vacation, have her sign up.

8. **Exercise**

To avoid depression and anxiety and maintain positive energy, it is important that you advise her, or even accompany her, to exercise, whether it is going for a walk, run, bike ride, pilates or yoga. This will also help you not stay at home and gain strength to better face the next steps and to stay active.

9. **Seek support**

Help her find support, information, advice and people who are specialized or who are in the same situation in recognized associations and entities in the field, such as the AECC (Spanish Association Against Cancer), ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), HABITS, etc. There are many means where she can go, she is not and will not be alone.

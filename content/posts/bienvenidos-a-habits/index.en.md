## HABITS? Yes!

Hello everyone,

Welcome to the **HABITS** Blog. We want to present you this Blog that aims to bring truthful and quality information on **physical exercise** and **health advice** for chronic diseases such as **cancer**, **cardiovascular diseases**, * *respiratory diseases** among others.

**HABITS** was born from the experience of its founders in health research projects on physical activity and chronic diseases. After several years carrying out national and European research projects, we want the population to have the necessary information to maintain or increase their quality of life after being diagnosed with a health problem.

When we are diagnosed with a disease, we often focus on pharmacological treatment, which is very important and necessary, but we forget about other parallel treatments that help us to have better health results, the modification of lifestyles, including **PHYSICAL ACTIVITY**. This very important element of: **MOVING** is the `pill` that the pharmaceutical industry would like to find. We know that exercise has a protective effect against many diseases or favors their prognosis.

Due to the importance of including movement in our lives, from **HABITS** we will regularly provide you with the benefits of physical activity in different chronic diseases, as well as health advice.

Subscribe to **HABITS** and together we all help each other to empower our community in physical exercise and health!

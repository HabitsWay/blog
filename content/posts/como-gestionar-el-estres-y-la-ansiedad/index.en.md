Today stress and anxiety are more present in our lives due to the tasks and obligations that we have on a daily basis and that we are often unable to put aside or escape from. It is important to have time for oneself, take things more calmly, not do things by inertia, enjoy what you do, think about what you are going to do in the afternoon, treat yourself from time to time, etc. .
At the time you are diagnosed with cancer, stress and anxiety are even more common because our routine suddenly changes, not controlling the situation makes us more nervous, restless, insecure and less Little by little, if you don't control the situation and don't let them help you, you can end up in a depression or having an anxiety attack.

It's easy for you to think:
* Because I?
* What have I done wrong?
* Should I have done other things, like more exercise, eat better, be more active…?
* Should I have taken things more slowly?

Although sometimes we blame ourselves for everything that happens to us, it seems that, today, there is no direct relationship between stress and cancer, that is, stress should not be the reason for having cancer. It is clear that stress is not good for anyone, as it can contribute to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity and diabetes, in addition to changes in your mood, but there are no studies let them relate for now.
We are going to propose some exercises that may help you reduce or avoid stress and anxiety. All this is valid if you are in an initial state of stress, as long as it is not a case that we can no longer cure with "remedies" that one can apply oneself. If you see that your nervous state is maintained or worsens or you have an anxiety attack, it is important to go to the doctor. As we mentioned in the previous post, you can also go to a psycho-oncologist as they can help us feel better, and most importantly, learn to face and manage our emotions. Stress blocks, does not allow us to think clearly and can affect, in addition to our health, our habits and our personal relationships.

Tips for managing stress:

1. Recognize that the disease cannot be changed.
Try to accept the situation as soon as possible since you have to look forward and look for the best alternatives for you and your health.

2. Avoid stressful situations.
If there is something in your day to day that causes you stress, run away. For example, if you feel overwhelmed by staying at the office for lunch, go eat out or go for a walk. If going alone to the doctor causes you stress, ask someone to accompany you.

3. Exercise.
Being physically active is the best way to deal with stress, the brain releases chemicals that make you feel good. It also helps combat frustration. In the coming days, from HABITS we will present some physical exercise sessions to manage stress and anxiety.

4. Change perspective.
Replace your negative thoughts with positive thoughts, for example, instead of thinking why did it happen to me? Try to change it to “I have been given a guideline to follow and I am going to comply with it”.

5. Look for moments to enjoy.
If you feel stress, it is important that you do what you like and dedicate that moment to yourself, whether it is reading a book, going shopping for clothes, meeting a friend, etc.

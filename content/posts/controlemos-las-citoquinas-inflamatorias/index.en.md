At Habits, we are continuously looking for information and technology for our users. For this reason we follow the scientific news. At the beginning of July we found a very interesting article in one of the main databases of **scientific evidence** <<[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)>> (for those of you who are not from the scientific world) and we wanted to share his information with you. Why? Because it relates chronic inflammation, chronic diseases and how lifestyle and lack of physical exercise contribute to the progression of the disease.

Previously (See post [What is a chronic disease?](/posts/que-es-una-enfermedad-chronica)) we had presented the numbers of chronic diseases in our country. And they are alarming. At Habits, we are very aware of public health and, as this article describes, the health expenditure that chronic diseases entail in any budget. This is important? Yes, of course! Because perhaps the health plans should include more prescription of physical exercise in the prescription of the treatment of many chronic diseases. If the theory of this article is confirmed, which wants to understand and verify what is the mechanism of action of the release of **inflammatory cytokines** (they are proteins that favor inflammation) caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. We know that these proteins, the cytokines, favor inflammation and the progression of chronic diseases.

If the theory is verified, the scientific community will have taken another step to understand how lifestyles play an important role in our health and thanks to physical exercise we could try to improve not only one chronic disease but several at the same time. Why? Because too many of us suffer from more than one disease at the same time, the so-called comorbidity or associated morbidity (two or more disorders or diseases that occur in the same person).

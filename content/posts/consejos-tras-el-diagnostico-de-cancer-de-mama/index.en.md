The previous entry was based on some advice for those who have a close person who has been diagnosed with breast cancer.
In this case, we will give some advice and/or recommendations for people who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. We will explain it to you, since at **HABITS** we want to help at all times and, most importantly, that you do not feel alone.

1. Talk to someone

It is normal that you need to talk to someone about what is happening to you, but especially with someone who is going through the same thing as you. Advice will not always help you, a loved one may want to help you, but until we experience it in the first person we often do not know how to give what is needed.

2. Stay active

It is very important that you do not stay at home and do physical exercise whenever your body allows it. There will be days that are heavier than others, but not letting yourself go is vital in order not to decay psychologically or physically. It will help you stay fit, control weight, improve fatigue, provides strength, energy and positivity. It should be noted that, depending on the stage you are in, you can do some exercises or others.

3. Psycho-oncology

You can go to this branch of psychology, since they are professionals who offer you specialized cancer therapy, and also your relatives, to face the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The `ICO (Catalan Institute of Oncology)` and the `AECC (Spanish Association Against Cancer)` offer this service, for example.

4. Visits two by two

When you go to the doctor, if you are accompanied you will save yourself having to explain or talk to people who want to comment on their case or know about yours. Tiredness or your mood at the time may be the reason you don't want to talk. Sometimes it's worth disconnecting, don't feel bad about it.

5. Disease follow-up

Follow all medical check-ups. Don't skip the treatment. Consult without fear any new symptom or variation. Even if it's hard, it's important that you get involved so you don't lose the joy of doing everything you like and being with the people you love. Do the exercises they recommend.

6. Attitude towards the disease

You are not guilty of anything. Contact self-help groups if you think it is convenient and take the time you need. Share your feelings and emotions with those who are closest to you. Don't let illness become the center of your life, seek tranquility and pleasure outside of it.

7. Healthy habits

- Eat a healthy and balanced diet. Eat what you like if the treatment has taken away your appetite, it will help lift your spirits, but don't get used to eating whims ðŸ˜‰. Drink a lot of water.
- It goes without saying that tobacco and alcohol are not compatible.
- Taking care of the skin is also important, use a lot of moisturizing cream, since the treatment will leave your skin rougher and cause dehydration. If you prefer, use oil, sometimes they have less chemical products.

8. Visit the associations

Look for support in associations, federations or cancer entities, since they offer support services, you will be able to meet people who are at the same point as you, they will help you take it in a different way, they will advise you, and many other aspects that can help you. You can go to the `AECC (Spanish Association Against Cancer)`, to `ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology)`, to the `FECMA (Spanish Federation of Breast Cancer)` and many others that we will inform you about. **HABITS** you can also include it as your point of support and reference.

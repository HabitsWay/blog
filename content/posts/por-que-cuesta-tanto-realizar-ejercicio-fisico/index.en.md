International institutions such as the `World Health Organization (WHO)` insist on the importance of regular physical activity to help prevent and control heart and respiratory diseases, various types of cancer, depression, anxiety, etc. In addition, it helps you maintain a healthy body weight, improve physical and mental health, quality of life and well-being. If it were a pill, it would possibly be the best-selling pill in the world to prevent and/or treat chronic diseases.

Everything and knowing the benefits it brings us, the reality is quite another. According to the `WHO`, **60%** of the world population does not perform any type of physical activity or physical exercise.

What are the main reasons that prevent us from doing more physical activity or improving our habits?

The main barriers are:
* Lack of time (I don't have time? With the things I have to do, where am I going to find time? It's impossible)
* Laziness (the typical excuses: I start tomorrow, nothing happens for a day, with how good it is on the couch watching a movie)
* Lack of social support (Who can I exercise with? Will I not be able to do it alone?)
* Doubts about the best option for me (Can I do strength training? Is going for a walk enough?)
* Lack of energy (I am too tired to exercise)
* Lack of motivation (I've never exercised enough to begin with. This is not for me!
* Lack of self-confidence (I'm clumsy! I'm not good at exercising! At school I always failed gymnastics)
* Lack of economic resources (money, material, sportswear, nearby spaces)
  Why will the HABITS method be different? We will answer you in the next post.

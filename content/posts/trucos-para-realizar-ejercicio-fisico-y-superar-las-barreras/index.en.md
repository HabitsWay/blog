As we mentioned in the previous post, all the benefits of exercising or physical activity on a regular basis, the reality is that very few people do the recommended dose or amount of physical exercise to obtain these benefits.
If this is so, why will the HABITS method be different? We are going to respond to each of the main barriers and how we solve them with the HABITS method.

* **Lack of time** (I don't have time? With the things I have to do, where am I going to find time? It's impossible)

  The daily session of physical exercise does not have to last more than 20 minutes. Did you know that the `WHO` recommends the option of doing 10-minute intervals of Physical Exercise, so you can forget about having to dedicate hours every day.

  In addition, in **HABITS** you will also have health tips for time management, to help you be more efficient, not only for physical exercise, but also for other things that we always want to do, but for which we never find the time. weather.

* **Laziness** (the typical excuses: I start tomorrow, nothing happens for a day, with how good it is on the couch watching a movie)

  We could use a Chinese proverb, such as remember that the best time to do something was yesterday, the second best time is now! Another well known is that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the second best time is now. Don't procrastinate.

  Everything and that, of course, it is essential that you contribute your grain of sand, at **HABITS**, we have created a personalized plan where every day you will be offered a session, a piece of advice, a challenge, an objective always seeking satisfaction, improve adherence to the program and, above all, results.

* **Lack of social support** (Who can I exercise with? Will I not be able to do it alone?)

  It is common to think that nobody around us practices physical exercise or who practices it does not fit with our preferences. However, usually if you start asking family, friends, at work, etc. Possibly you will find that you were not the only one who thinks the same and that there are more people who are in your situation. So you will surely find the person or people with whom you can carry out an activity that motivates you and with social support. It's simple, but many times talking we find solutions.

  On the other hand, there are public entities, such as the town hall, the sports or social service of your locality that will offer this type of sessions and physical exercise programs through the municipal sports center or civic center, so we recommend that you look at their website or you come to ask in person, surely you will find many more options than you imagined.

  Another alternative that is gaining more and more strength are private entities such as **HABITS** and that virtually design your physical exercise sessions where you can also have the support of qualified professionals who will accompany you along the way to that you never feel alone. For example, at HABITS you will always have a whole team of professionals behind you to help you achieve your goals and answer any questions via chat or video calls. We will also propose options and alternatives, to be more active with friends, families or even institutions or associations that can also help you according to your needs.

* **Doubts about the best option for me** (Can I do strength training? Is going for a walk enough?)

  This is the most normal, there is more and more information on the internet, blogs, which is often contradictory, so anyone can be overwhelmed and generate more doubts. I will tell you a secret, even to those of us who dedicate ourselves professionally, at certain times we have certain doubts, since every day there is new scientific evidence, each person has needs, objectives, preferences. So you always have to be working, training and learning to obtain the greatest benefits in the most efficient way for each person. But don't worry, this part is up to us üòä

* **Lack of energy** (Am I too tired to exercise?)

  It is true that especially the first few days, when we start doing physical exercise we tend to be more tired, it is logical. But what happens when we maintain these habits for days? The body becomes more efficient and improves our aerobic resistance, strength, so to do the same we need less effort, so we can do more things and at the same time be less tired. That's how fantastic it is! In addition, doing physical exercise on a regular basis has been shown to help reduce anxiety, nerves, improve sleep quality, etc. So, although it may be an effort at first, give it a try and you'll see how you won't regret it!

* **Lack of motivation** (I've never exercised enough to begin with. This is not for me!)

  We are not going to fool ourselves, it is clear that you have to look for motivation and even more so if you have never practiced any sport or physical exercise or you have never liked it. What we can guarantee you is that at **HABITS** we are going to do everything on our part to help you find and maintain that motivation.

* **Lack of self-confidence** (How clumsy I am! I'm not good at exercising! In school, I always failed gymnastics)

  These statements are so typical and at the same time so false, that they make us limit ourselves and put up barriers that are not real. Today, there are countless options and alternatives, anyone with desire and accompanied by professionals, is able to perform physical exercise, and not only that, but to enjoy it and obtain its benefits. We have to get rid of possible bad experiences, some of which even go back to physical education classes or recess when we went to school.

* **Lack of economic resources** (money, material, sportswear, nearby spaces)

  It is possible that in the past all these barriers existed, especially the economic one, but today, you can find the right clothing and footwear for an extremely low price, low cost gym memberships, physical exercise programs subsidized by entities or municipalities, etc. . This should no longer be a limitation for not doing physical exercise.



At this point, we only ask you to give it a try and start TODAY and don't wait until tomorrow to exercise, you won't regret it!
